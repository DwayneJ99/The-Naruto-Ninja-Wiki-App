# The Pokemon Wiki App

Welcome to the Pokemon Wiki

In this application I used HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT to help me build a pokemon wiki. For this project the approach I taken was to build a simplified pokedex where the user can search any pokemon and get back the pokemon's type, name, and abilities.
